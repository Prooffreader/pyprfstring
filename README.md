# pyprfstring
## (unreleased, pre-alpha, nothing to see here yet)
A privately hosted package for string manipulation

Even though this is privately hosted, the source code is public and even the "private pypi" is publicly accessible, so if you want to install it, you can. Obviously, you do so at your own risk.

I prefix all of my repositories in my private simple pypi server with "pyprooff-", short for "pyprooffreader", to keep them straight in my head.

### Installation
  
    pip install --extra-index-url https://www.dtdata.io/prooffpypi pyprfstring
